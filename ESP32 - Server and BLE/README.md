# ESP32 BLE Server Project

This project demonstrates how to use the **ESP32** as a **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) server**.  
The ESP32 is configured to advertise itself and provide a custom **GATT service** with RX (write) and TX (notify/read) characteristics.

- **Device Name**: `GroupII chas advanced`  
- **RX Characteristic**: Allows a BLE central (like a smartphone app) to send data to the ESP32.  
- **TX Characteristic**: The ESP32 can notify and send data back to the central device.  
- The server also supports periodic notifications (uptime), and echoes back any text received.

## Use Cases
- **IoT applications**: sensors sending data over BLE  
- **Mobile communication**: ESP32 acting as a peripheral device  
- **Embedded systems learning**: understanding BLE GATT services and server roles  

## How It Works
1. ESP32 starts advertising under the name **GroupII chas advanced**  
2. Connect with a BLE scanner app (e.g., nRF Connect or LightBlue)  
3. Write data to the **RX characteristic** â†’ ESP32 receives it and echoes back  
4. Enable notifications on the **TX characteristic** â†’ ESP32 sends periodic uptime data
