# IoT GroupII – Climate Controlled Logistics Monitor  

This project is an **IoT-based logistics system** designed to guarantee **climate-controlled delivery of special goods** (e.g., bananas).  
The system monitors and logs **temperature, humidity, and GPS location** during transportation, ensuring traceability and quality control.

## 🌐 System Overview  
![System Architecture](infrastrukturbild.PNG)  

- **Sensor Nodes (S)** inside cargo measure temperature & humidity.  
- **ESP32 Broker (C)** inside the vehicle collects sensor data via **WiFi or Bluetooth**.  
- **Mobile Unit (M)** forwards data to the **Web Server (W)** over **4G/5G**.  
- **GPS** provides continuous location tracking.  
- Data is logged both **locally** and in the **backend** for redundancy.

## 🚛 Logistics Flow (Chas Advance)  
![Logistics Overview](Oversikt.PNG)  

1. **Warehouse Checkout** – Packages scanned (barcode + mobile terminal) → activates logging & sensor suite.  
2. **Transport** – Truck/train/airplane; handover possible with new base unit.  
3. **Monitoring & Control** – Data logged locally + sent to backend; vehicle unit can regulate climate conditions.  
4. **Delivery** – Data finalized upon arrival and logged at the receiving warehouse.
